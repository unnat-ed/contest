Features:

1. A single page home page for contests has been used. Number of total pages are just three to minimise the effort and time of the user.

2. The recent events have been shown in the form of a linear timeline to facilitate an easy and approachable to the users as they can 
   get a short-hand glimpse of the recent contests that happened in and around the campus.

3. The ongoing and upcoming contests are shown in the form of square grid tiles which will include the poster of the contest. Upon hovering,
   a brief description along with the club organising it can be stated.

4. An informal footer is provided at the bottom for disclaimer and contacts for queries. Moreover, a switch to top has also been used.

5. In case *if there are no ongoing or upcoming contests in the nearby future a contest_not_found page is also made
   (index_notfound.html) which can be connected via backend with the condition that there are no contests.*

6. The archives page can be accessed through the navbar. The pagination is done through the top right pop-down animation. *Each button can be linked
   to the corresponding pages via back-end.*

7. The navbar has different groups of clubs which can be linked to the classifications of each club which will contain sorted cards of only 
   those club's activities. *This will be done via back-end.*

8. The flip cards contain leaderboards at the rear end with a link to the detailed view of the contest.

9. In case the contest is an ongoing one, the leaderboard is replaced with a message having the link to the detailed event.

10. The detailed event page will contain a poster at the right followed by the information of the complete contest. The page will contain cards 
    of the organising club with the logo and the coordinator name. These will be fixed for the whole site.

11. A pulsating home button fixed at the top-left corner will take us to the home page back again.

12. At the end, registration link is available which opens up the registration form as a modal. *This needs to be linked via backend.*

The home page is fully functional and is responsive.
The archive and detail page has some responsiveness bugs that are yet to be resolved.
All the views of the form are not yet shown. But they can be completed easily within a few hours or so.
